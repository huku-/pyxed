## Converting C datatypes to Python PyObjects

Most functions exported to Python are simple wrappers around the low level C API
offered by XED2. To be properly returned to the user, the return values of those
C functions must be converted to one of the datatypes recognized by the Python
runtime (i.e. `PyObject` pointers). For the sake of developing **pyxed**, I
settled down to the following set of simple guidelines:

  * When a XED2 function returns `xed_uint_t` to indicate a true/false result,
    or `xed_bool_t` (also `typedef`'ed to `unsigned int`), use `PyBool_FromLong()`
    to retrieve the corresponding Python object.

  * When functions return arbitrary values of type `xed_uint_t`, use
    `PyLong_FromUnsignedLong()`.

  * For return values of type `xed_*_enum_t`, use `PyInt_FromLong()`
    (according to the C standard, enumerations are treated as `int` values).
